### Heya folks, thanks for checking out my Github profile :)

I am an amateur coding hobbiest.

I have limited experience with GV-Basic (variant of GW-Basic), Free Pascal, Visual Basic 6.0, C#, Javascript/Typescript, HTML and SQL. Never went to school for CS, instead I took accounting and economics classes.

- 📝 I’m currently working on a small Blazor project using C#/JS/TS/SQL/HTML
- 💼 I have a full-time job with a financial institution unrelated to software development
- 🏡 I live in Canada
- 🍕 I am on a diet (hopefully not for long)
